                Luxury Listing Pages was founded by Serg Mahalo, a computer engineering student from Wentworth Institute
                of Technology in Boston, Massachusetts. Combining a background in technology with a deep understanding
                of real estate, Serg saw a critical gap in the market: high-end real estate agents needed better tools
                to showcase their properties in a way that matched the prestige of the homes they were selling.
              </p>
              <p className="text-silver">
                Too often, multi-million-dollar estates are reduced to generic listings on crowded platforms, blending
                in with lower-tier properties. Luxury buyers expect exclusivity‚Äîthey want personalized, immersive
                experiences that highlight the lifestyle a property offers, not just its specs. That's why Serg created
                Luxury Listing Pages, a premium service dedicated to providing real estate professionals with elegant,
                highly optimized, and lead-driven property websites.
